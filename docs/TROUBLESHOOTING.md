## Catch Any Voice Exception

All library exceptions implement the `VoiceException` marker interface. You can catch any voice-related error with a single handler instead of listing every exception type:

```php
use Discord\Voice\Exceptions\VoiceException;

try {
    $manager->joinChannel($channel)->then(function ($client) {
        // ...
    });
} catch (VoiceException $e) {
    echo 'Voice error: ' . $e->getMessage() . PHP_EOL;
}
```

Individual exception classes (`LibDaveNotFoundException`, `EnterChannelDeniedException`, etc.) remain available for fine-grained handling when needed.

## LibDaveNotFoundException — libdave not found

**What it means:** Discord required DAVE E2EE (end-to-end encryption) for all voice and video connections starting **March 1st, 2026**. This library now requires `libdave` to connect to any voice channel. The exception message includes the underlying FFI load error from `LibDaveNotFoundException::fromRuntimeError()`.

**How to fix it:**

The easiest way is to run the included setup script, which auto-detects your OS and architecture (Linux, macOS, Windows — x64 and ARM64), downloads the correct `libdave` release asset, and verifies its SHA-256 digest:

```bash
./scripts/setup-libdave.sh
```

This installs the library into `.cache/libdave/` relative to the package root. The runtime auto-discovers it there — no environment variable needed.

**Alternatively**, point the runtime at an existing `libdave` installation:

```bash
export DISCORDPHP_DAVE_LIBRARY=/path/to/libdave.so   # Linux
export DISCORDPHP_DAVE_LIBRARY=/path/to/libdave.dylib # macOS
```

**Prerequisites** (required before `libdave` can load):

- PHP [`ext-ffi`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.ffi.php) must be enabled:
  ```ini
  ; php.ini
  extension=ffi
  ffi.enable=true
  ```

- On **Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)**:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install php-ffi
  ```

- On **Linux (RHEL/Fedora)**:
  ```bash
  sudo dnf install php-ffi
  ```

- On **macOS**:
  ```bash
  brew install php
  # ext-ffi is bundled; ensure ffi.enable=true in php.ini
  ```

- On **Windows**: `php_ffi.dll` ships with PHP 8.x; uncomment `extension=ffi` and set `ffi.enable=true` in `php.ini`.

**Verify the setup:**

```bash
export DISCORDPHP_DAVE_LIBRARY="$PWD/.cache/libdave/lib/libdave.so"
./vendor/bin/pest tests/Unit/Dave/RuntimeTest.php
```

## FFmpegNotFoundException — ffmpeg not found

**What it means:** `ffmpeg` was not found on your system `PATH`. ffmpeg is required to encode audio for playback via `playFile()` and `playRawStream()`.

**How to fix it:**

- **Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)**:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install ffmpeg
  ```

- **Linux (RHEL/Fedora)**:
  ```bash
  sudo dnf install ffmpeg
  ```

- **macOS**:
  ```bash
  brew install ffmpeg
  ```

- **Windows**: Download a static build from [ffmpeg.org/download.html](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html), extract it, and add the `bin/` folder to your system `PATH`.

**Verify:**

```bash
ffmpeg -version
```

---

## OpusNotFoundException — libopus not found

**What it means:** The Opus shared library (`libopus`) was not found. It is required for Opus codec support used in audio send and receive.

**How to fix it:**

- **Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)**:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install libopus-dev
  ```

- **Linux (RHEL/Fedora)**:
  ```bash
  sudo dnf install opus-devel
  ```

- **macOS**:
  ```bash
  brew install opus
  ```

- **Windows**: Download pre-built Opus binaries from [opus-codec.org](https://opus-codec.org/downloads/), or install via `vcpkg`:
  ```
  vcpkg install opus
  ```

## LibSodiumNotFoundException — libsodium not found

**What it means:** PHP's `ext-sodium` extension is not enabled. libsodium is used to encrypt and decrypt RTP voice packets.

**How to fix it:**

`ext-sodium` has been bundled with PHP since **7.2** — you just need to enable it.

1. Find your active `php.ini`:
   ```bash
   php --ini
   ```

2. Uncomment or add the following line:
   ```ini
   extension=sodium
   ```

3. On **Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)**, the package may need installing first:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install php-sodium
   ```

4. On **Linux (RHEL/Fedora)**:
   ```bash
   sudo dnf install php-sodium
   ```

5. Restart your PHP process after editing `php.ini`.

**Verify:**

```bash
php -m | grep sodium
```

## DCANotFoundException / OutdatedDCAException — DCA binary missing or outdated

**What it means:** The `dca` binary was not found, or the installed version is too old. DCA is a **legacy** audio format.

**Recommended fix — migrate away from DCA:**

DCA playback (`playDCAStream()`) is a legacy path. The modern equivalents are:

```php
// Play any file or URL (uses ffmpeg + Ogg/Opus internally):
$vc->playFile('/path/to/audio.mp3');

// Stream raw PCM:
$vc->playRawStream($pcmStream);

// Stream a pre-encoded Ogg/Opus stream:
$vc->playOggStream($oggStream);
```

**If you must keep using DCA:**

Download the `dca` binary from [github.com/bwmarrin/dca](https://github.com/bwmarrin/dca/releases) and place it somewhere on your system `PATH`.

```bash
# Example for Linux x64:
chmod +x dca-linux-amd64
sudo mv dca-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/dca
```

## CantSpeakInChannelException — bot missing Speak permission

**What it means:** The bot does not have the **Speak** permission in the target voice channel.

**How to fix it:**

1. Open your Discord server settings → **Roles** or the channel's **Edit Channel** → **Permissions**.
2. Grant the bot role (or the bot user directly) the **Speak** permission on the voice channel.

The bot requires both **Connect** and **Speak** to participate in voice.

---

## EnterChannelDeniedException — bot missing Connect permission

**What it means:** The bot does not have the **Connect** permission for the target voice channel.

**How to fix it:**

1. Open **Edit Channel** → **Permissions** for the voice channel.
2. Grant the bot role (or user) the **Connect** permission.

If the channel has a user limit set and is full, the bot also needs the **Move Members** permission to bypass it.

---

## AudioAlreadyPlayingException — audio already playing

**What it means:** You called `playFile()` (or another playback method) while audio was already playing. Only one audio source can play at a time.

**How to fix it:**

Stop the current audio before starting new playback:

```php
$vc->on('ready', function () use ($vc) {
    $vc->playFile('/path/to/first.mp3');

    // To play a second file, stop the first:
    $vc->stop();
    $vc->playFile('/path/to/second.mp3');
});
```

Or queue tracks by listening to the `end` event:

```php
$vc->on('ready', function () use ($vc) {
    $vc->playFile('/path/to/first.mp3');
});

$vc->on('end', function () use ($vc) {
    $vc->playFile('/path/to/second.mp3');
});
```

---

## ClientNotReadyException — client not ready

**What it means:** A playback method was called before the voice client finished connecting. The client is not ready to send audio yet.

**How to fix it:**

Always start playback inside the `ready` event:

```php
$discord->voice->joinChannel($channel)->then(function (VoiceClient $vc) {
    $vc->on('ready', function () use ($vc) {
        // Safe to call playback methods here:
        $vc->playFile('/path/to/audio.mp3');
    });
});
```

Do not call `playFile()`, `record()`, or similar methods directly inside the `join()` promise callback — wait for `ready`.

## BufferTimedOutException — audio stream stalled

**What it means:** The audio send buffer waited too long for the next chunk of data and timed out. This usually means the source stream stopped producing data.

**Common causes and fixes:**

- **File not found or unreadable** — verify the path and permissions:
  ```bash
  ls -la /path/to/audio.mp3
  ```

- **URL source is slow or unreliable** — use a local file for testing to rule out network issues.

- **ffmpeg process crashed** — check that `ffmpeg` is installed and can decode the file format:
  ```bash
  ffmpeg -i /path/to/audio.mp3 -f null -
  ```

- **Stream pipe closed early** — if you are piping a custom `ReadableStreamInterface`, make sure it does not close before the audio finishes.

- **System under heavy load** — the React event loop may be starved. Avoid blocking calls (e.g. synchronous I/O, `sleep()`) on the same loop tick as audio playback.
