# Copilot Instructions

## Commands

| Purpose | Command | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Install dependencies | `COMPOSER_ROOT_VERSION=dev-main composer install --no-interaction --prefer-dist` | The root version override is required by the `team-reflex/discord-php` dev dependency. |
| Run the default Pest suite | `composer unit` | Expands to `pest --testdox`. |
| Run the parallel Pest suite | `composer pest` | Expands to `pest --parallel`. |
| Run one Pest test file | `./vendor/bin/pest tests/Unit/Voice/WSSequenceAckTest.php` | Use the file path when you want an exact class/file. Pest reads the same `tests/` tree and `phpunit.xml` config. |
| Run one Pest test by name | `./vendor/bin/pest --filter="heartbeat uses last received gateway sequence"` | Pest filters by the human-readable test description, so use a quoted description substring. |
| Run coverage | `composer coverage` | Requires Xdebug because the script sets `XDEBUG_MODE=coverage` and Pest writes the HTML report to `coverage/`. |
| Format with php-cs-fixer | `composer cs` | This is the formatter called out in `CONTRIBUTING.md`. |
| Check php-cs-fixer without rewriting files | `./vendor/bin/php-cs-fixer fix --dry-run --diff` | Use this when you only want a style check. |
| Run Pint | `composer pint` | Uses `pint.json` and enforces `declare(strict_types=1)`. |
| Run PHPLint | `phplint` | CI installs this as a standalone tool and uses `.phplint.yml`. |

For native DAVE coverage on Linux x64, run `./scripts/setup-libdave.sh`, then export `DISCORDPHP_DAVE_LIBRARY="$PWD/.cache/libdave/lib/libdave.so"` before running the DAVE tests.

## High-level architecture

- `Discord\Voice\Manager` is the entry point for joining voice. It validates channel permissions, creates one voice client per guild, listens for the main gateway `VOICE_STATE_UPDATE` and `VOICE_SERVER_UPDATE` events, and only resolves the join promise after the voice client emits `ready`. Session IDs are tracked in `Discord::$voice_sessions`.
- `Discord\Voice\Client` is a backwards-compatible subclass of `VoiceClient`. Nearly all behavior lives in `VoiceClient`.
- `VoiceClient` is the high-level state machine for playback and recording. It owns speaking state, sequence/timestamp counters, receive streams, decoder processes, and public operations like `playFile()`, `playRawStream()`, `playOggStream()`, `record()`, and `stopRecording()`.
- `Discord\Voice\Client\WS` owns the voice gateway connection: identify/resume, heartbeats, reconnects, speaking events, client connect/disconnect events, session description handling, and all DAVE gateway opcodes. `Discord\Factory\SocketFactory` is used from here to create the UDP client.
- `Discord\Voice\Client\UDP` owns IP discovery, UDP heartbeats, and RTP packet send/receive. It wraps outbound and inbound voice frames in `Discord\Voice\Client\Packet`, which handles RTP headers plus libsodium encryption/decryption.
- Outbound audio flow is `playFile()` / `playRawStream()` -> `Processes\Ffmpeg::encode()` -> `OggStream` packet reads -> `UDP::sendBuffer()` -> `Packet::encrypt()`. `playFile()` accepts local files or URLs, `playRawStream()` feeds PCM into ffmpeg with `-f s16le`, and `Ffmpeg::encode()` always emits Opus on stdout for `playOggStream()` to consume.
- `playOggStream()` is where send timing is established. It buffers the Ogg stream, sets speaking state, delays the first send by 500 ms, and then `readOggOpus()` schedules one packet per frame on the React loop. That method also owns the 16-bit sequence rollover, 32-bit timestamp rollover, and EOF/reset behavior.
- Inbound audio flow starts when `record()` attaches a UDP message listener. `handleAudioData()` maps SSRCs through `speakingStatus`, creates per-user `ReceiveStream` instances on demand, decodes Opus to PCM, and emits `channel-opus` / `channel-pcm` events.
- DAVE E2EE support is split across `Discord\Voice\Client\WS`, `Discord\Voice\Dave\State`, and `Discord\Voice\Dave\Runtime`. The gateway negotiates DAVE protocol versions and MLS group transitions. **libdave is mandatory**: both `Manager::__construct()` and `WS::__construct()` throw `LibDaveNotFoundException` immediately if `DaveRuntime::isAvailable()` returns false — Discord has required DAVE E2EE for all voice/video connections since March 1st, 2026. The `Dave\Runtime` singleton wraps `ext-ffi`+`libdave.so` and exposes `isAvailable()`, `getLastLoadError()`, `maxProtocolVersion()`, `configureCallbacks()` (test hook), and `reset()` (test teardown).
- `Discord\Voice\Dave` handle types — `SessionHandle`, `EncryptorHandle`, `DecryptorHandle`, `KeyRatchetHandle` — are thin PHP wrappers around opaque DAVE FFI pointer types. `BinaryFrame` parses and serialises binary voice gateway frames (opcode + sequence + payload bytes) for DAVE gateway messages. `Dave\State` tracks per-connection MLS state: protocol version, group ID, self user ID, passthrough mode flag, and the last received gateway sequence (`seq_ack`).
- `Discord\Voice\OggPage` and `Discord\Voice\OggStream` implement Ogg container parsing. `OggStream` feeds decoded Opus pages into the send pipeline; `OpusHead` and `OpusTags` parse the Ogg Opus header pages.
- `Discord\Voice\ByteBuffer` (`Buffer`, `ReadableBuffer`, `WriteableBuffer`, `AbstractBuffer`, `BufferArrayAccessTrait`, `FormatPackEnum`) is the active byte-buffer implementation used throughout the library. `Discord\Voice\Helpers\ByteBuffer` is a legacy duplicate of the same code retained for backwards compatibility — prefer the non-`Helpers` namespace for new code.
- `Discord\Voice\Processes\Ffmpeg` and `Discord\Voice\Processes\DCA` are child-process wrappers. `Ffmpeg::encode()` always emits Opus on stdout. `Discord\Voice\Processes\OpusFfi` is an FFI-based Opus decoder alternative (marked `@todo`; not yet used in production paths). Both decoders implement `Discord\Voice\Processes\OpusDecoderInterface`.
- `Discord\Voice\Client\User` is a value object (created on inbound audio) that bundles an SSRC, decoder `Process`, `ReceiveStream`, and optional `Speaking` part for a connected voice user.
- `Discord\Voice\Exceptions` is a structured hierarchy: `Exceptions\Channels\` for channel-permission errors (`CantJoinMoreThanOneChannelException`, `CantSpeakInChannelException`, `ChannelMustAllowVoiceException`, `EnterChannelDeniedException`) and `Exceptions\Libraries\` for missing native dependency errors (`LibDaveNotFoundException`, `LibSodiumNotFoundException`, `FFmpegNotFoundException`, `OpusNotFoundException`, `DCANotFoundException`, `OutdatedDCAException`). All are bare `\Exception` subclasses; exceptions that need runtime context (e.g. `LibDaveNotFoundException`) expose a named static factory (`::fromRuntimeError()`) rather than building the message at the call site.
- `Discord\WebSockets\VoicePayload` is the typed DTO for voice gateway JSON payloads; `Discord\WebSockets\OpEnum` is the voice opcode enum. `Discord\Parts\Voice\UserConnected` represents a connected-user Part.

## Key conventions

- Preserve the public backwards-compatibility shims. `Discord\Voice\Client` still exists as an alias subclass for `VoiceClient`, and `ReceiveStream` still subclasses the legacy misspelled `RecieveStream`. Do not remove or rename these surfaces without keeping compatibility.
- `VoiceClient::setData()` is the boot trigger once `token`, `endpoint`, `session`, and `dnsConfig` are present. If you change join/setup flow, update `Manager`, `VoiceClient`, and `Client\WS` together so the handshake still reaches `ready`.
- Playback state changes are strict. Most public playback methods reject when the client is not ready or is already speaking; `pause()` keeps cadence by refreshing silence frames, `stop()` drains the buffer and inserts silence, and `setVolume()` / `setAudioApplication()` are intentionally blocked while audio is playing.
- DAVE frame transforms are injected through `Client\Packet` callbacks and routed through `VoiceClient::encryptDaveFrame()` / `decryptDaveFrame()`. Changes to packet handling need to preserve both RTP encryption and the optional DAVE media layer.
- `Client\WS` records the last gateway sequence in `Dave\State` and reuses it in both heartbeat and resume payloads as `seq_ack`. Changes around reconnect, resume, or binary voice frames need to keep that bookkeeping intact.
- DCA support is legacy. New work should prefer the Ogg/Opus path (`playOggStream()` / `playRawStream()` / `Ffmpeg::encode()`), while `playDCAStream()` remains for compatibility.
- Exceptions in `Exceptions\Libraries\` are bare `\Exception` subclasses. When the exception message depends on runtime state (e.g. an FFI load error), add a `public static function fromRuntimeError(): self` factory to the exception class and throw via `throw ExceptionClass::fromRuntimeError()` — never inline the message-building at the call site.
- Tests for DAVE and voice gateway behavior usually avoid live sockets. The existing tests build `WS` and `VoiceClient` instances with reflection, inject mocked Discord/WebSocket objects, and use `Runtime::configureCallbacks()` to simulate native DAVE behavior. Only the explicit runtime coverage in `tests/Unit/Dave/RuntimeTest.php` expects a real `libdave` library.
- New PHP source follows the repository-wide pattern: `declare(strict_types=1);`, PSR-4 `Discord\` namespaces, and the standard DiscordPHP file header. Use the existing php-cs-fixer/Pint configuration instead of hand-formatting.

## Test patterns

- **Directory split**: `tests/Unit/` covers pure-logic classes (no sockets, no async) — e.g. `OggStream`, `Packet`, `Dave\State`, `Dave\BinaryFrame`. `tests/Feature/Voice/` covers gateway/WebSocket behaviour with mocked sockets and injected Discord objects.
- **No shared helper file**: test helper functions are defined inline at the bottom of each test file (after a `// Helpers` comment). Name them descriptively with the file's subject (e.g. `makeWsForSessionInitTest`, `makeDiscordForManagerRequirementTest`).
- **Reflection-based construction**: classes with complex constructors (`Discord`, `Channel`, `WS`, `VoiceClient`) are built with `(new \ReflectionClass(Foo::class))->newInstanceWithoutConstructor()`. Private properties are injected via `\ReflectionProperty::setAccessible(true)` then `setValue()`. Protected test-only methods are invoked via `\ReflectionMethod::setAccessible(true)` then `invokeArgs()`.
- **Mocking**: use PHPUnit's `$this->getMockBuilder(SomeClass::class)->disableOriginalConstructor()->onlyMethods(['emit'])->getMock()`. Mockery (`Mockery::mock()`) is not used in this project.
- **Payload capture**: to assert what `WS` sends over the wire, pass an `array` by reference into the mock `WebSocket::send()` closure — `$ws->send = function (string $data) use (&$sentPayloads) { $sentPayloads[] = json_decode($data, true); };` — then assert against `$sentPayloads` after calling the method under test.
- **DAVE stubbing** (three strategies):
  1. `Runtime::configureCallbacks(availabilityOverride: false)` — makes `isAvailable()` return false without unloading the real library. Use this to test the libdave-unavailable code path in non-RuntimeTest files.
  2. `Runtime::configureCallbacks(availabilityOverride: true, ...)` — injects fake native callbacks (encrypt/decrypt/etc.) so the MLS session flows run without a real `libdave.so`. Use this in Feature tests that exercise DAVE MLS state machine transitions.
  3. Real `libdave.so` — only `tests/Unit/Dave/RuntimeTest.php` loads the real library; all other tests must not depend on it.
- **DAVE test teardown**: every test file that calls `Runtime::configureCallbacks()` must include `afterEach(function (): void { Runtime::reset(); });` at the top level to restore the singleton state between tests.
- **Skipping without libdave**: use `$this->markTestSkipped('Requires libdave to be available.')` (PHPUnit style) when a test needs the real library and `DaveRuntime::isAvailable()` returns false.
- **`Dave\BinaryFrame` construction**: gateway binary messages are built with `BinaryFrame::encode(opcode, seq, payload)` (or the static helpers) and passed directly to the `WS` handler under test.
